abstract = {Abstract Although the California Current System extends as far 
south as the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula (BCP), some 
past model domains have employed an open boundary near the Mexico-US 
border, excluding Sebastián Vizcaíno Bay (SVB), a hook-like coastal 
feature at mid-length of the BCP. An earlier modeling study has shown the 
SVB to be a previously unknown forcing region that governs SSH variability 
in the Southern California Bight (SCB). Motivated by that evidence, our 
aim is to understand the variability that originates from the SVB and to 
identify what is lost in a numerical model of the SCB when the SVB is 
excluded. To do this we use an idealized configuration of the MITgcm, 
without tides, using the bathymetry with the bay and comparing it to model 
runs where the bay is removed. Our results show that a short wind event 
(≤4 hr) blowing over SVB can enhance variability everywhere in the 
domain. First, the event excites a seiche in the bay at frequency 5.2 cpd. 
Then, seiche energy leaks into the domain in the form of gravity waves 
that are topographically amplified in the SCB, coastal trapped waves 
(CTWs) that travel north along the coast, and internal waves, that enhance 
vertical velocity variance at particular depths by up to 27\% compared to 
experiments without the SVB. Given the frequency of wind events like the 
one modeled, our results suggest that the SVB is a continuous source of 
gravity waves, internal waves, and CTWs to the SCB.},
