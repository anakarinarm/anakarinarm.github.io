The influence that one canyon may have on the flow dynamics of an adjacent one is not clear. It might be tempting to assume that the first canyon or upstream canyon leads the dynamics, since water will go through it before passing to the downstream canyon. However, the role of the downstream canyon is not trivial as coastal-trapped waves are moving in the opposite direction to the shelf current in the case of upwelling canyons. This means that information is also being transmitted from the downstream canyon to the upstream one. This type of interaction has been observed in Barkley Canyon where shelf waves propagating northward can have a stronger effect on alongshore currents than the local wind. We are studying how submarine canyons interact dynamically using a physical model.\nRelevant publications   PhD Thesis  ","date":1590624000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621901908,"objectID":"fa651a417aad3f19e27085d618b7dd0a","permalink":"https://anakarinarm.github.io/en/project/multiple-project/","publishdate":"2020-05-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/project/multiple-project/","section":"project","summary":"What is the impact of multiple canyons in the dynamics of canyon-induced upwelling?","tags":["Ocean"],"title":"Interaction among multiple canyons","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Submarine canyons incise continental shelves all over the world. They are hot spots of biodiversity mainly because they act as conduits for biologically relevant tracers (such as nitrate, phosphate, etc.) by enhancing upwelling. I am studying the impact that submarine canyons have on the amount of tracers that is exchanged between the shelf and the deep ocean, and the spatial and temporal distribution of the upwelled tracer on the shelf. I use an idealized canyon bathymetry and the MIT general circulation model (MITgcm) to develop a scaling scheme for tracer transport onto the shelf given the incomming flow, geometric and geographic parameters of the canyon, tracer profile, and vertical diffusivity and viscosity within the canyon.\nRelevant publications   Saldías, G.

On a regional scale, submarine canyons enhance physical processes such as shelf–slope mass exchange and mixing. There is good understanding of the flow around upwelling submarine canyons; however, the flux of biologically relevant tracers is less understood. This work investigates the impact of submarine canyons on the cross-shelf exchange of tracers and water, taking into account the impact of locally enhanced mixing within the canyon, and develops a scaling estimate for canyon-induced upwelling of tracers, proportional to local concentration, vertical diffusivity, and previously scaled upwelling flux. For that purpose, we performed numerical experiments simulating an upwelling event near an idealized canyon, adding a passive tracer with an initially linear profile. We varied the geographic distribution of vertical eddy diffusivity and its magnitude, the initial stratification, the Coriolis parameter, and the strength of the incoming flow. We find that a canyon of width 5% of the along-shelf length of the shelf upwells between 25% and 89% more tracer mass onto the shelf than shelfbreak upwelling. Locally enhanced vertical diffusivity has a positive effect on the tracer that is advected by the upwelling flow and can increase canyon-upwelled tracer flux by up to 27%.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"The Impact of Locally Enhanced Vertical Diffusivity on the Cross-Shelf Transport of Tracers Induced by a Submarine Canyon","type":"publication"}]
