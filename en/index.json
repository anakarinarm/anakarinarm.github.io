An earlier modeling study has shown the SVB to be a previously unknown forcing region that governs SSH variability in the Southern California Bight (SCB). Motivated by that evidence, our aim is to understand the variability that originates from the SVB and to identify what is lost in a numerical model of the SCB when the SVB is excluded. To do this we use an idealized configuration of the MITgcm, without tides, using the bathymetry with the bay and comparing it to model runs where the bay is removed. Our results show that a short wind event (≤4 hr) blowing over SVB can enhance variability everywhere in the domain. First, the event excites a seiche in the bay at frequency 5.2 cpd. Then, seiche energy leaks into the domain in the form of gravity waves that are topographically amplified in the SCB, coastal trapped waves (CTWs) that travel north along the coast, and internal waves, that enhance vertical velocity variance at particular depths by up to 27% compared to experiments without the SVB. Given the frequency of wind events like the one modeled, our results suggest that the SVB is a continuous source of gravity waves, internal waves, and CTWs to the SCB.","tags":null,"title":"High-Frequency Variability Induced in the Southern California Bight by a Wind Event in Sebastián Vizcaíno Bay, Baja California","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Authors: Burgos-Cuevas, A., Ruiz-Angulo, A., Palacios Morales, C.

New observational evidence suggests that the propagation of coastal trapped waves (CTWs) over a submarine canyon can also cause upwelling within the canyon, independent of the wind forcing. Here, we use idealized numerical experiments to assess the role of CTWs in promoting the onshore transport of deeper waters onto the continental shelf. The experiments are forced with a 7-days period CTW. Overall, there is accumulated upwelled water in time with increased onshore transport during the low sea level phase of the CTWs. Most of the onshore flow is spread over the upwave side of the canyon during the low sea level phase, but it is advected further downwave during the subsequent high sea level phase. As a result, a dense pool of upwelled water is spread over the shelf extending primarily in the downwave direction.","tags":null,"title":"Circulation and Upwelling Induced by Coastal Trapped Waves Over a Submarine Canyon in an Idealized Eastern Boundary Margin","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1621814400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621901710,"objectID":"2c4892560c2c55e693eb400bf770fd72","permalink":"https://anakarinarm.github.io/en/project/mountain-project/","publishdate":"2021-05-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/project/mountain-project/","section":"project","summary":"Are mountain waves generated around the valley and do they have an impact in Mexico City's air quality?","tags":["Atmosphere"],"title":"Mountain waves in the Valley of Mexico","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1620259200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651973186,"objectID":"3dedb157e5e2ec400c8d7f5dc58c0b6f","permalink":"https://anakarinarm.github.io/en/project/svb-project/","publishdate":"2021-05-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/project/svb-project/","section":"project","summary":"What variability do we miss in our models if we don't include Sebastián Vizcaino Bay?","tags":["Ocean"],"title":"Wave activity induced by Sebastián Vizcaino Bay","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Semestre 2021-1 Facultad de Ciencias, UNAM\nLog-log plots (In Spanish)   Notebook  Least squares - linear functions (In Spanish)   Notebook  Selected Notebooks from the activity \u0026ldquo;Mysterious Dataset\u0026rdquo; (In Spanish)    Dataset 1 - SSH in Huatulco, Oaxaca by Samantha Alanis, Luis Fernando López y Berenice Pizano.\n   Dataset 2 - Ozone measurements at two stations in Mexico City by Aura Campos, Lucía Martínez y Paola Sánchez.\n   Dataset 3 - Solar Radiation in Cambridge Bay, Nunavut, Canada by Alicia Hernández, Ana Paula Martínez y Montserrat Ruiz.\n   Dataset 4 - Surface air temperature in Cambridge Bay, Nunavut, Canada by Alondra Blas, Kenya Díaz y Lucía Kirene Larson.\n  Resources (In Spanish)  Introduction to Python notebook 01 Introduction to Python notebook 02  ","date":1590624000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607030685,"objectID":"6b7d852279ac94614d62ebc1411e67e0","permalink":"https://anakarinarm.github.io/en/teaching/tecnicas_exp/","publishdate":"2020-05-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/teaching/tecnicas_exp/","section":"teaching","summary":"In Spanish only","tags":["Teaching"],"title":"Experimental Techniques, Facultad de Ciencias, UNAM.","type":"teaching"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Submarine canyons are not isolated features; they occur one after the other along the continental shelves around the world. The influence that one canyon may have on the flow dynamics of an adjacent one is not clear. It might be tempting to assume that the first canyon or upstream canyon leads the dynamics, since water will go through it before passing to the downstream canyon. However, the role of the downstream canyon is not trivial as coastal-trapped waves are moving in the opposite direction to the shelf current in the case of upwelling canyons. This means that information is also being transmitted from the downstream canyon to the upstream one. This type of interaction has been observed in Barkley Canyon where shelf waves propagating northward can have a stronger effect on alongshore currents than the local wind.

Previous studies assume that canyon-induced tracer flux onto the shelf only depends on canyon-induced water upwelling. This paper investigates the validity of this dependence for nutrients, carbon, and dissolved gasses. To estimate the canyon-induced tracer upwelling flux and its spatial distribution on the shelf, we performed numerical experiments simulating an upwelling event near an idealized canyon, adding 10 passive tracers with initial profiles representing nutrients, carbon, and dissolved gasses. This paper presents a scaling estimate for canyon-induced tracer upwelling and for the on-shelf distribution of a given tracer. We find that tracer upwelling depends on the vertical local mean of the initial vertical tracer gradient within the canyon, the depth of upwelling and the upwelling flux. We identify a pool of low oxygen and high nutrient concentration, methane, dissolved inorganic carbon, and total alkalinity on the shelf bottom, downstream of the canyon. The downstream extension of the pool of low oxygen water depends on the onshore flux of water through the canyon and the oxygen profile. This canyon-induced distribution of tracers has the potential to impact demersal and benthic ecosystems by lowering dissolved oxygen levels and spreading corrosive waters along the shelf.","tags":null,"title":"The Impact of Initial Tracer Profile on the Exchange and On‐Shelf Distribution of Tracers Induced by a Submarine Canyon","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Authors: Karina Ramos-Musalem and Susan E.

On a regional scale, submarine canyons enhance physical processes such as shelf–slope mass exchange and mixing. There is good understanding of the flow around upwelling submarine canyons; however, the flux of biologically relevant tracers is less understood. This work investigates the impact of submarine canyons on the cross-shelf exchange of tracers and water, taking into account the impact of locally enhanced mixing within the canyon, and develops a scaling estimate for canyon-induced upwelling of tracers, proportional to local concentration, vertical diffusivity, and previously scaled upwelling flux. For that purpose, we performed numerical experiments simulating an upwelling event near an idealized canyon, adding a passive tracer with an initially linear profile. We varied the geographic distribution of vertical eddy diffusivity and its magnitude, the initial stratification, the Coriolis parameter, and the strength of the incoming flow. We find that a canyon of width 5% of the along-shelf length of the shelf upwells between 25% and 89% more tracer mass onto the shelf than shelfbreak upwelling.
