I am a physical oceanographer interested in the interactions between ocean and atmospheric flows and topography. In particular, I use numerical models and laboratory scale models to investigate the role that topography plays in facilitating cross-shelf exchanges of water, nutrients, carbon and dissolved gases.

 I did my Ph.D. at the Mesoscale Ocean and Atmospheric Dynamics Group under the supervision of [Professor Susan Allen](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/~sallen/) at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/). Previously, I did my undergraduate thesis at [Centro de Ciencias de la Atmosfera](https://www.atmosfera.unam.mx/), UNAM.
