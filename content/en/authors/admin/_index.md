I am a physical oceanographer and I'm interested in the interaction between geophysical flows -- such as the ocean and the atmosphere -- and topography. In particular, I use numerical and laboratory models to investigate the role that topography plays in the exchange of water, nutrients, and dissolved gases between the deep ocean and the continental shelf.

I'm part of the [Department of Physical Oceanography](https://www.cicese.edu.mx/investigacion/oceanografia_fisica/1") at the [Center for Scientific Researcha nd Higher Education of Ensenada, Baja California (CICESE)](https://www.cicese.edu.mx/).

I was a researcher in the [Ocean-Atmosphere Interaction group](http://grupo-ioa.atmosfera.unam.mx/index.php/) at [Instituto de Ciencias de la Atmósfera y Cambio Climático](https://www.atmosfera.unam.mx/) from 2021 to 2024. 

Before, I did my Ph.D. in the Mesoscale Ocean and Atmospheric Dynamics Group under the supervision of [Professor Susan Allen](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/~sallen/) at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/).
